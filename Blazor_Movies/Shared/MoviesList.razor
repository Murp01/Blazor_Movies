@*This page is a component.  This can be called in a page and it will carry out its purpose
    This Componenet uses the Movie entity to create instances of movies.  There is an if statement
        That will first check if the movies are null (not loaded), if so, it will then check
        if there are more than 0 movies when Task is loaded.  If there are not message will be displayed
        if so then the if statement will print each movie's title and release date

        MoviesList is a reusable piece of code that can be reused anywhere in the application

        Try adding <MoviesList /> to any other routed page.  E.g /Counter
        The Movies list parameter is used to accept movie properties passed into the MoviesList html
        tag when it is declared on the page <MoviesList Movies="nameOfMovieListItem" />

        DisplayButtons component use.  IndividualMovie component is using the DisplayButtons component
        It is using the displayButtons boolean variable as the argument.  This argument is then passed
        to the component and when true/false value is picked up it is used in IndividualMovie if statement
        to display or not
